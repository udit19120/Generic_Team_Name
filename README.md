<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>
Most of the customers want a time efficient purchase mechanism of fashion products along with emphasis on health and safety rather than visiting stores. Especially, in the case of fashion & beauty products, it is very common that you order a product but then realize that it gives a different look in reality. So, a lot of customers want a contactless feature to try products at home.  Also,  as the competition  in the tech-fashion industry is  increasing day by day as new platforms are coming up, thereâ€™s a need to come up with innovative engagement strategies to make the overall shopping experience more engaging.
</p>

<h3>Solution Statement</h3>
<p>
We want to introduce a contactless feature in which the users can actually try the beauty products and clothes by using Machine Learning and Computer Vision. To attract more customers to our platform, we want to introduce various engaging games that the user can play and earn benefits like discounts, MynCash, etc.
